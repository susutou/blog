It's an understatement to say that it has been a while since I last posted.
So much has happened in the past 2 years, ups and downs, tears and joy ---
but I am happy to say that I am alive and well!

To rediscover balance in my life I am getting back into drawing and watercolor painting.
My current project is to bookbind a sketchbook with dedicated watercolor paper so I can
enjoy sketching with watercolor.

It's great to be back.

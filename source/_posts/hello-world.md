Hello there. As usual, every time I open a new blog, I'd initialize with a "Hello, world!" post.
My new blog is set up with [Hexo](http://hexo.io/), a "fast, simple & powerful blog framework".
I simply bought back my original domain name from [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
and set up the site on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

I will try to import my old articles into this blog, but not all of them, as I already do not agree with
some of my earlier opinions. However, for technical articles, I'll keep posting and refining till
they meet my quality. I am really thrilled to start writing again (in both 中文 / English).

Anyway, a new journey has started and I am ready to embrace it! Thank you all.
